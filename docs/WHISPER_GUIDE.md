# Local Speech-to-Text with Whisper

This implementation uses OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate, fast, and private speech-to-text transcription.

## 🎯 Why Whisper?

- **Accuracy**: State-of-the-art speech recognition
- **Privacy**: Runs completely locally, no data sent to external services
- **Speed**: Fast processing on local hardware
- **Multilingual**: Supports 99+ languages
- **No API Keys**: No external dependencies or costs

## 🚀 Model Options

The application supports different Whisper model sizes based on your needs:

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy | Use Case |
|-------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| `tiny` | ~39 MB | Fastest | Good | Quick demos, low-end hardware |
| `base` | ~74 MB | Fast | Better | **Default - good balance** |
| `small` | ~244 MB | Medium | High | Better accuracy needed |
| `medium` | ~769 MB | Slower | Very High | High accuracy requirements |
| `large` | ~1550 MB | Slowest | Best | Maximum accuracy |

## ⚙️ Configuration

Set your preferred model in the `.env` file:

```env
# Options: tiny, base, small, medium, large
WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE=base
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Model Loading**: Whisper model loads once at startup
2. **Audio Processing**: Audio files are processed locally
3. **Transcription**: Text is extracted using the neural network
4. **Results**: Transcribed text is returned to the application

## 📊 Performance

### Hardware Requirements:
- **CPU**: Any modern processor (4+ cores recommended)
- **RAM**: 2GB+ (more for larger models)
- **GPU**: Optional CUDA-compatible GPU for faster processing
- **Storage**: 100MB-2GB depending on model size

### Expected Processing Times:
- **1 minute audio**: 2-10 seconds (depending on model and hardware)
- **GPU acceleration**: 2-5x faster processing
- **First run**: Slower due to model download and loading

## 🎵 Supported Audio Formats

Whisper supports various audio formats:
- WAV (recommended)
- MP3, FLAC, M4A
- Most common audio formats

## 🌍 Multilingual Support

Whisper automatically detects language or you can specify:
- English (default)
- Spanish, French, German
- Chinese, Japanese, Arabic
- 99+ total languages supported

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

The implementation includes:
- **Automatic language detection**
- **Confidence scoring**
- **Word-level timestamps**
- **Segment-based processing**
- **Error handling and fallbacks**

## 🔍 Monitoring

The backend logs provide real-time information:
```
Loading Whisper model: base
✅ Whisper model 'base' loaded successfully
Using device: cpu
Transcribing audio file: uploads/12345.wav
✅ Transcription completed: 156 characters
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Model Download Fails**:
   - Check internet connection
   - Ensure sufficient disk space
   - Try a smaller model size

2. **Slow Processing**:
   - Use smaller model (`tiny` or `base`)
   - Ensure sufficient RAM
   - Consider GPU acceleration

3. **Poor Accuracy**:
   - Use larger model (`small` or `medium`)
   - Ensure clear audio input
   - Check for background noise

4. **Memory Issues**:
   - Use smaller model
   - Close other applications
   - Process shorter audio clips

## 🎯 Optimization Tips

1. **For Speed**: Use `tiny` or `base` models
2. **For Accuracy**: Use `small` or `medium` models  
3. **For Production**: Use `base` model as good balance
4. **For GPU**: Install CUDA-compatible PyTorch
5. **For Storage**: Models are cached after first download
